changes made in order to have a connection between databse instance and api instance. (reference screenshot is also attached on my project, kindly have a look on that)

vi /api/app.json

var pg = require('pg');
var conString = "postgres://postgres:password@terraform-20200722154649654100000001.c31frw5xutol.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/mydb";

(fyi, username of my postgres database is "postgres", pasword "password",
added the endpoint of my database instance along with port number and db name)



changes made to have communication between api server and web server. (reference screenshot is attached on my project/repo)

vi web/routes/undex.js

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var request = require('request');


var api_url = 'http://<public_ip_address_of_my_api_server>:3000/api/status';
